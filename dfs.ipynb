    "[Depth-first search](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-depth-first-search) (DFS), is an algorithm for tree traversal on graph or tree data structures. It can be implemented easily using recursion and data structures like dictionaries and sets.\n",

    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Lines 2-9: The illustrated graph is represented using an adjacency list - an easy way to do it in Python is to use a *dictionary* data structure. Each vertex has a list of its adjacent nodes stored.\n",
    "-   Line 11: `visited` is a set that is used to keep track of visited nodes.\n",
    "-   Line 21: The `dfs` function is called and is passed the `visited` set, the `graph` in the form of a dictionary, and `A`, which is the starting node.\n",
    "-   Lines 13-18: `dfs` follows the algorithm described above:\n",
    "    1.  It first checks if the current node is unvisited - if yes, it is appended in the `visited` set.\n",
    "    2.  Then for each neighbor of the current node, the `dfs` function is invoked again.\n",
    "    3.  The base case is invoked when all the nodes are visited. The function then returns."
